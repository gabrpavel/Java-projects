# Lesson 2
## 
1. VideoRegistrator: implement the calcStartTimes method, so that the number of recorder activations for a given period of time (1) is minimal and all events were registered.
2. Sheduler: given interval events implement the calcStartTimes method, so that the number of non-overlapping events accepted for execution is maximized.
3. GreedyKnapsack: Given 1) volume of the backpack 4; 2) number of possible items 60; 3) the set of items itself

    100 50
    120 30
    100 50
   
These are all listed in the file **[DATA](greedyKnapsack.txt)**
You need to assemble the most expensive version of the backpack for this volume. Items can be cut into pieces (the algorithm will be greedy)
